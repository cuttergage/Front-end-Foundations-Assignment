					<h1>Hey! I'm Cutter Gage.</h1>
					<p>I am a Thinkful student living in Kansas City, Missouri, USA. I am currently studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am excited to continue to grow my knowledge base to prepare me for a career change into the software engineering field.</p>
          <p>As an artist, I value beauty, intention, and simplicity. I am passionate about learning the techincal skills required for creating thoughtful website architecture that promotes a comprehensive user experience. With a deep commitment to integrity, effectivity, and efficiency, I hope to bring a meaningful contribution to the world of web development.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="group">
        <div class="item item-double">
          <p>I have spent the last 16 years of my life focusing on playing, writing, and recording music. While my passion in that area will continue, I have had increased excitement in recent months around the idea and opportunity to learn a new technical skill in software engineering.</p>
          <p>What feels appealing about coding is the intersection between technique and design. I am detail-oriented and thus appreciate structure and accuracy. In tandem to that, I deeply enjoy having an outlet for creativity to express beauty in a way that brings a platform above and beyond what is simply functional. The field of web development allows me the opportunity to think strategically to accomplish objectives within a creative environment for both front-end and back-end work. By the end of my training, I will be able to offer clients high-quality work in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.</p>
          <p>An additional value and priority I hold is the commitment to work with people - whether that be clients, users, or fellow developers. If you're looking for a new junior developer to add to your team, please don't hesitate to reach out! I would be thrilled to have the chance to collaborate with other experienced coders who are passionate about their craft that I could learn from.</p>

		<p>(Live, Working App Link Coming Soon)</p>
					<p>This assignment was my first opportunity to use JavaScript to answer questions in a real-life scenario. With challenges around number of campsites reserved or available, maximum camper capacity, and which campsites had which view, this scenario gave me an outlet to cut my teeth on basic JavaScript functions.</p>

          <p><a href="https://cuttergage.github.io/HTML-CSS-Portfolio/">HTML/CSS Portfolio (Live Link)</a></p>
					<p>This was my first webpage design using HTML and CSS. My primary objective was to present some basic information about myself in a straight-forward, user-friendly way. My aesthetic goal was to take a minimalistic approach, using neutral colors that coincided with my profile picture to create a clean and professional display. This project honed my functional and styling capabilities by importing fonts, using headers, modifying images, implementing ordered and unordered lists, and making direct links to other webpages.</p>

					<p>(Live, Working App Link Coming Soon)</p>
					<p>This project was my first in-depth exposure to how JavaScript can be utilized to structure the internal operations of a business. The goal of this assignment was to create a number of functions that could facilitate the necessary operations of a local library, such as tracking lended books, finding and sorting accounts, and identifying the most popular books and authors. This project really grew my JavaScript function implementation skills and experience.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/cuttergage/Project-Decoder-Ring.git">Project: Decoder Ring (GitHub Repository Link)</a></h3>
					<p>(Live, Working App Link Coming Soon)</p>
					<p>This project was a challenge to use JavaScript functions to encode and decode secret messages with a variety of different ciphers. With alternate alphabet modifiers like Caesar shift, Polybius square, and Substitution cipher, this assignment refined my ability to work with complex JavaScript functions to manipulate strings of letters, numbers, and non-alphabetic symobls.</p>
